# chevron.html

Html is one attempt (of many) to make the act of writing HTML slightly
safer and easier. It offers elements as objects with properties and a system
of using PHP's magic __call() to create them quickly and inline.

If there is a downfall to this system (and *every* other system designed to tackle
the same task) it is that for all the buzz words I've tried to incorporate (OOP,
Di, testable, blah blah blah) it remains a very customized solution and using it
will couple an application to this (or that) specific toolset.
